This is a conversation between Barbara and a conner where conner is acting as a professional and Barbara as a client. The gestures are given in Square brackets and you can disregard that. Now consider the conversation below as the scenario and I will give you the questions and answers later.

Conner acting as the Professional [kind, slow paced tone of voice]: 

Barbara, before we talk any further about what brings you in today and what's going on with you, I wanted to take a moment to review our confidentiality policy. 

[Professional pauses and smiles] 

ClientBarbara: OK. 

Conner acting as the Professional: You have signed the Personal Health Information Protection form out in the waiting room. You've likely signed that in other places. And that's about a law that requires us to protect your privacy and the privacy of your health information. We will not share information about you or your health condition with anyone outside of our immediate team without your written permission. 

So if, for example, you were working with another professional in the community and you wanted us to talk with them, we couldn't do that until we had both signed a release of information at your request. And that would tell us exactly what we could talk about, and it would specify the time period for how long we could share information. 

Does that make sense? 

â€¦ 

[Professional pauses and smiles] 

Client Barbara:: Yes. 

Conner acting as the Professional: There are a couple of exceptions, however, where we are required to share your information even without your permission. One of those situations is if we learn that you're at risk of harming yourself or someone else. For example, if we learn that you have a plan to hurt yourself or others, we would have a duty to report that information to protect your safety or the safety of others. 

Another situation would be if we are legally required to report something, like suspected child abuse or neglect. We are obligated by law to disclose information in such cases, even if you didn't give us permission. 

Now that I've gone over our confidentiality practices, I'm wondering if you have any questions about them? 

Client Barbara:: No I don't right now. 

Conner acting as the Professional: OK. Can you just repeat back to me what your understanding is of our confidentiality policy.. .in your own words, can you just tell me how you understand it? 

Client Barbara: I understand that you will keep my information confidential unless you are required to report that I'm planning to harm myself or others or if you are legally obligated to disclose something, like in cases of child abuse. 

Conner acting as the Professional: Thank you, Barbara. Now we can get into to talking about what brings you in today. So, tell me what your concerns are.
